2,"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 10:43 EST, 19 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:56 EST, 20 November 2012 . Syrian rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad clashed with armed Kurds near the Turkish border today in the latest sign of a new power struggle in Syria's ethnically diverse north-east. Exploiting the unravelling of Assad's grip in wide swathes of Syria, Kurds have been asserting control in parts of the northeast, bidding for the self-rule and rights denied to their community for decades under Assad and his father before him. Some fear the increasingly sectarian tinge of the anti-Assad uprising will splinter Syria. But whoever takes charge in the Kurdish plains nudging against Turkey will control a chunk of Syria's estimated 2.5 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. A father comforts his son who has just undergone surgery for a bullet wound in his left shoulder outside a field hospital in the northwestern city of Maraat al-Numan, Syria . On Monday, gunfire clattered in the mixed Arab and Kurdish frontier town of Ras al-Ain, which was overrun by the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels on November 8 and bombed by Assad's forces in the days that followed. Fleeing residents said the fighting was between insurgents of the Free Syrian Army and Kurds affiliated with the Democratic Union Party, a Syrian Kurdish party with links to Kurdish separatist militants in Turkey. Opposition activists at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported clashes, with a rebel advance into Syria's Kurdish heartland meeting resistance. Kurds in the region are suspicious of the Free Syrian Army and whether any post-Assad, Islamist-dominated government would be more accommodating of Syria's largest ethnic minority. The Observatory said at least four Kurdish militiamen had been wounded in the fighting and that a rebel sniper had shot dead the leader of Ras al-Ain's local Kurdish Council, Abed Khalil. 'The injuries were the result of clashes between the two sides when rebels launched an assault on a checkpoint belonging to the Units for the Protection of the Kurdish People,' it said, referring to a PYD-affiliated militia.

3,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Picture this: you're sat down for the Football World Cup final, or a long-awaited sequel to the ""Sex and the City"" movie and you're watching all the action unfold in 3-D on your coffee table. The future of television? This image is an impression of what 3D holographic television may look like. It sounds a lot like a wacky dream, but don't be surprised if within our lifetime you find yourself discarding your plasma and LCD sets in exchange for a holographic 3-D television that can put Cristiano Ronaldo in your living room or bring you face-to-face with life-sized versions of your gaming heroes. The reason for renewed optimism in three-dimensional technology is a breakthrough in rewritable and erasable holographic systems made earlier this year by researchers at the University of Arizona. Dr Nasser Peyghambarian, chair of photonics and lasers at the university's Optical Sciences department, told CNN that scientists have broken a barrier by making the first updatable three-dimensional displays with memory. ""This is a prerequisite for any type of moving holographic technology. The way it works presently is not suitable for 3-D images,"" he said. The researchers produced displays that can be erased and rewritten in a matter of minutes. To create television sets the images would need to be changing multiple times each second -- but Peyghambarian is very optimistic this can happen. He said the University of Arizona team, which is now ten-strong, has been working on advancing hologram technology since 1990 -- so this is a major step forward. He believes that much of the difficulty in creating a holographic set has now been overcome. ""It took us a while to make that first breakthrough, but as soon as you have the first element of it working the rest often comes more rapidly,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is trying to make the model better. What we showed is just one color, what we are doing now is trying to use three colors. The original display was four inches by four inches and now we're going for something at least as big as a computer screen."" There are no more great barriers to overcome now, he said. The breakthrough has made some long-time researchers of the technology believe that it could now come to fruition. Tung H. Jeong, a retired physics professor at Lake Forest College outside Chicago who had studied holography since the 1960s told NJ.com; ""When we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms, we are moving toward the possibility of holographic TV ... It has now been shown that physically, it's possible."" And what might these holographic televisions look like? According to Peyghambarian, they could be constructed as a screen on the wall (like flat panel displays) that shows 3-D images, with all the image writing lasers behind the wall; or it could be like a horizontal panel on a table with holographic writing apparatus underneath. So, if this project is realized, you really could have a football match on your coffee table, or horror-movie villains jumping out of your wall. Peyghambarian is also optimistic that the technology could reach the market within five to ten years. He said progress towards a final product should be made much more quickly now that a rewriting method had been found. However, it is fair to say not everyone is as positive about this prospect as Peyghambarian. Justin Lawrence, a lecturer in Electronic Engineering at Bangor University in Wales, told CNN that small steps are being made on technology like 3-D holograms, but, he can't see it being ready for the market in the next ten years. ""It's one thing to demonstrate something in a lab but it's another thing to be able to produce it cheaply and efficiently enough to distribute it to the mass market,"" Lawrence said. Yet, there are reasons to be optimistic that more resources will be channeled into developing this technology more quickly. The Japanese Government is pushing huge financial and technical weight into the development of three-dimensional, virtual-reality television, and the country's Communications Ministry is aiming at having such technology available by 2020. Peyghambarian said there are no major sponsors of the technology at present, but as the breakthroughs continued, he hopes that will change. Even if no major electronics company commit themselves, there is hope that backers could come from outside of the consumer electronics industry, he said. ""It could have some other applications.

He joked: 'I was such a hit, I retired in 1922 and made a comeback at seven.'

In 1947, Kerr moved to England and from November 2, 1954 began appearing opposite Tony Hancock (who he called 'Tubs'), Sid James and Moira Lister in the iconic radio series Hancock's Half Hour. Writer Alan Simpson also appeared uncredited but could not be considered a main character. Hancock's Half Hour, written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, began on radio in 1954.

His Honour Judge Simon Brown QC has been criticised by the Court of Appeal for copying large parts of his ruling from the closing submissions of one side in a £1.8m court case . A top judge has been reprimanded after he copied almost every word of a ruling which left a father and son ruined by a £1.8 million debt. Judge Simon Brown QC, who earns nearly £130,000-a-year for sitting on the bench, lifted 'word for word' chunks of one side's written arguments before condemning entrepreneur, Declan Crinion, and his elderly father, Tommy, to a life of penury. Underlining that 'appearances matter', the Court of Appeal laid into Judge Brown's plagiarism and warned that such 'thoroughly bad practice' must never happen again. Lord Justice Underhill said that 'almost all' of Judge Brown's ruling was 'taken word for word' from written submissions put in by financial brokers, IG Markets Ltd, who sued the Crinions after they lost a fortune gambling on derivatives at the height of the financial crisis. Dismissing the Crinions' appeal today, . Lord Justice Underhill ruled - 'not without some hesitation' - that, . despite his copying, Judge Brown, who earns a total of £129,579-a-year, had 'performed his essential judicial . role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently . apparent'. Despite 'a number of small verbal changes' made by the judge, the overall impression was that his decision was 'derived almost entirely' from IG Markets' closing submissions. The Crinions' lawyers had calculated that, when setting out the facts of the case, Judge Brown had used 'some 94 per cent' of the words originally drafted by IG Markets' legal team. There was also 'no alteration whatever to the structure'. The judge, sitting with Sir Stephen Sedley and Lord Justice Longmore, said: 'In my opinion, it was indeed thoroughly bad practice for the judge to construct his judgment in the way that he did.' By adopting IG Markets' arguments wholesale, Judge Brown had given the impression that he had not considered the case independently and even-handedly. Although there was 'nothing inherently wrong' in making use of such documents, Lord Justice Underhill said: 'I have never before seen a case where the entirety of the judgment has been based on one side's submissions in the way that occurred here'. Sir Stephen Sedley said the Crinions said they felt the judge had never properly engaged with their case or fairly considered their defence when it was heard at the Mercantile Court sitting at the Birmingham Civil Justice Centre. He added: 'The possibility of something approaching electronic plagiarism is new and it needs to be said and understood that it is unacceptable. 'Even if it reflects no more than the judge's true thinking, it reflects poorly on the administration of justice... appearances matter.' He concluded: 'I hope that a judgment like this one now before us will not be encountered again'. Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Underhill dismissed the Crinions' appeal and said despite his copying, Judge Brown had 'performed his essential judicial role' and his reasons for ruling against the pair were 'sufficiently apparent' Those tough words will, however, come as . little comfort to the Dublin-based Crinions, after the court ruled . that, whatever his failings, Judge Brown had nevertheless reached the . right result and the pair could not be let off the hook. In his April 2012 ruling, Judge Brown had said that Declan Crinion, was 'charmingly frank about his addictive gambling nature and of his sad financial demise'. He claimed IG Markets had let him down and the judge observed: 'As he put it, with a humour evocative of W.C Fields, ""they should not open the bar and give an alcoholic the opportunity to drink more than was good for him"".'

Father and son had their accounts compulsorily closed down by IG Markets in February 2009, within months of the Lehman Brothers collapse, and were left holding debts totalling more than £1.8m. Declan argued that although he operated all the accounts personally, only one of them was his limited risk responsibility. He also claimed IG Markets had overestimated his sophistication as an investor and should have limited his losses by closing the accounts sooner. Tommy denied authorising his son to operate an account in his name - he said his signature on a crucial document had been 'forged' by his son - and both men argued IG Markets had failed to do enough to protect them as consumers.

Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release, but they didn't -- at least not publicly. ""We didn't go there for that.

The trip also met with criticism because North Korea still holds Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in November 2012, convicted last spring by Pyonyang of ""hostile acts"" intended to topple the government, and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release, but they didn't -- at least not publicly. ""We didn't go there for that. We went there to do what we normally do, and that's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange,"" he said. Smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players weren't sent as representatives of the United States. ""We're athletes doing it ourselves,"" he said. When celebrity meets brutality . Smith said he has no regrets about going. He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met. Smith said the man told him they didn't have a very good view of African-Americans. The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off, Smith said. Rodman appears to bow, sings 'Happy Birthday' to North Korea's Kim . ""Then the next day after we talked for a while, he came up to me and said he was sorry,"" Smith said. The former NBA player, who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador, said he didn't go to any areas where people are hungry. Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea's sports minister and basketball players from the national team. He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip. ""We accomplished a relationship on the sports side in North Korea,"" he said. ""Where it goes from there, I do not know at this point in time. But we established a relationship. They've asked us to come back. Whether we go back or not, I'm not sure. I don't know. But there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that don't communicate."" Rodman apologizes for North Korea outburst, says he'd been drinking .",Dennis Rodman,Charles Smith Reflects on Basketball Diplomacy Trip to North Korea: 'We Accomplished a Relationship'
8,"Deep in to added time, Manuel Pellegrini was offered his Roberto Mancini moment. One chance for salvation, Sergio Aguero’s right foot. You know the story. If this wasn’t quite an instant to match that of Manchester City’s title winning moment against QPR of May 2012, it was certainly one to stir the soul in similar fashion. In football – in sport – there is nothing quite like a contest that swings in the closing moments. As he moves forwards, though, Pellegrini may realise that the similarities to Mancini’s day in the spring sunshine do not quite end with the score line and the name of the winning goal scorer. Manuel Pellegrini shares a moment with counterpart Pep Guardiola after being handed a lifeline . Aguero is mobbed by team-mates after firing City ahead in the dying seconds to complete a remarkable win . Aguero blasts City to their first Premier League title against QPR two years ago . For just as Mancini failed to capitalise on that amazing day two-and-half years ago, so Pellegrini must ensure that he does. This was magnificent, stomach-churning stuff. City needed it. English teams in Europe needed it. It will, however, mean absolutely nothing if Pellegrini and his hopelessly aimless team cannot capitalise, if they cannot use the adrenaline and the emotion of the experience to go on to better things. Mancini’s City team got worse after winning the league. Pellegrini’s side must get better quickly if this season is to amount to anything at all over the next six months. Aguero was scintillating. When isn’t he? Both of the opportunities he was afforded by calamitous Bayern Munich errors were perhaps 50-50 in terms of the probability of a goal. The first one was the most important – without the first there is no second – and that was the most difficult. Aguero levels for City to give them a Champions League lifeline... and better was to come at the Etihad . Aguero skips between Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski as the Argentina striker put in a dazzling display . The very best centre forwards, perhaps the top five per cent, have the ability almost to stop time when presented with opportunities that may frighten the life out of lesser sportsmen. Like leading golfers standing over six-foot putts, the idea of missing is simply alien to then. Here, on both occasions, there was a tangible calmness about the way that the Argentine advanced towards goal and executed, Two chances, two goals. Only the very best can do that and Aguero belongs in that category. That apart, though, there was very little to cheer here for Pellegrini and City. On the whole, this was another lamentable night for a team stuck in quick sand both domestically and in Europe at the moment. The result will have given everybody at this club and in this stadium a huge lift but only those who watched with their hands over their eyes will be able to ignore the issues that continue to blight this team. It is difficult to say that City played at all well at any stage of the game. They began poorly and were second best for a twenty minute period during which Bayern may have scored twice. Joe Hart blocked one effort and Eliaquim Mangala the other. Frank Lampard was a claming presence in City's engine room as they bounced back to beat Bayern . Lampard looks to the heavens after Xabi Alonso pulls Bayern level... but the Citizens would have the last laugh . Thanks to a super Frank Lampard pass, a rash challenge from Medhi Benatia and a typically well-executed Aguero penalty, City suddenly had the lead and a one-man advantage. On a night when only victory would do, this was their golden ticket. City, however, are so lame these days – so lacking in direction and belief – that even that wasn’t enough to nudge them towards anything remotely approaching superiority. By half-time they were trailing and the most damning thing of all is that nobody here was the slightest bit surprised. Over time, we expected City to impose themselves. Surely Bayern would tire and City would begin to stretch them and squeeze them at the same time. Remarkably, it just didn’t happen. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola summed it up best afterwards when he said: 'We lost the game, we gave them the game. 'Look at the second half. We had ten but Manny [Manuel Neuer] never had to make a save.' Aguero controls the ball as Bayern's Mehdi Benatia prepares to bring him down in the box . Benatia trudges off past Pep Guardiola after the Moroccan received his marching orders . Guardiola was not being deliberately provocative, merely presenting a pretty accurate story of what had happened. Bayern – without a clutch of key players – had kept City at bay with some comfort since edging ahead. There was no cavalry charge from City, merely lots of aimless football, devoid of rhythm and crispness, that was ultimately rendered irrelevant by two stunning Bayern errors that allowed Aguero in twice in quick succession. Quite simply, City must improve. One of their better players was Frank Lampard. Amid all the talk of extending his loan from New York City FC, it is pertinent to ask yourself this: why would he stay and play in a team that currently looks incapable of making a significant impression in the Premier League or in Europe?

A mental health nurse who started a sexual relationship with a patient in her care before bombarding him with texts when he broke it off has been struck off. Deborah Boulton was said to have met a male patient and given him her mobile number, texted him messages saying 'I miss you' and 'I love you'. The band 6 nurse's actions fell 'seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a nurse', a tribunal ruled, saying her ability to practice is impaired by reason of her misconduct. She was said to have met the man, known as Patient A, at the Sutherland Centre, for people with poor mental health, in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, in early 2009. Relationship: A tribunal heard Deborah Boulton had sex with one of her patients five times after meeting him at the Sutherland Centre in Stoke-on-Trent . A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing was told Boulton gave the patient, who had previously been treated in hospital for an alleged overdose of diazepam and alcohol issues, her mobile number and texted him, telling him 'I miss you' and 'I love you'. During their relationship the pair had sex around five times: once in a hotel, once in his mother's house and approximately three times in Boulton's house. The patient claimed when he tried to finish the relationship Boulton bombarded him with calls and texts until he destroyed his mobile phone to avoid contact from her. The panel heard Boulton went on to take sick leave leading to her case load being re-allocated, which eventually resulted in claims of their relationship emerging. The allegations came to light when Patient A attended a counselling session in August, where he suggested to a counsellor that he had suffered a relapse because of the relationship, the hearing was told. Boulton was not present and not represented at the hearing in central London last week, but had denied the allegations. The NMC Competence and Conduct Committee panel struck Boulton off, finding she breached professional boundaries by giving Patient A her phone number and instructing him to call her, and also found she had failed to maintain accurate records and failed to create a care plan for him. The panel accepted evidence given by Patient A that Boulton left voicemail messages on his phone saying words to the effect of: 'If you do not come and see me now then you will never see me again', and 'I will end the relationship and you will be alone because you will never see me again'. It also found proved allegations that the Boulton took the patient to Frankie and Benny's in Newtown, Stoke-on-Trent, between May and June 2009, and to dinner with a friend in May 2009, and also that she bought him alcohol on two occasions. The panel also found proved claims that the couple had sex on around May 12, 2009, in Patient A's bedroom at his mother's house in Longton; and that they stayed overnight at the Holiday Inn Express in Stoke-on-Trent near Britannia Stadium, where they also slept together. It was also found proven that during May and/or June 2009, the pair had sex approximately three times at Boulton's home. Deciding whether the facts proved amounted to misconduct, the panel ruled Boulton's actions fell 'seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a nurse and amounts to misconduct'. Striking her off, it said her failings were 'significant departures' from the standards expected. 'By placing her own needs above the needs of Patient A, Ms Boulton breached the fundamental tenets of the profession and the panel is of the view that to allow her to continue practising would fail to protect the public, and undermine public confidence in the profession and in the NMC as a regulatory body.' An 18-month Interim Suspension Order was also put in place to allow for the possibility of an appeal.

12,"A combative Barack Obama took aim Thursday night at Congressional Republicans for embracing social-issues talk about economic inequality as they flex their new majority muscles and look ahead to the 2016 presidential election. The president jabbed at the GOP, who he said have curiously begun emphasizing the needs of America's middle class and those in poverty. 'Even though their policies haven't quite caught up, their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty Democratic,' he said. 'I consider imitation the highest form of flattery.' Obama also filleted Mitt Romney, his 2012 election opponent, for focusing on the economics of ordinary Americans just three years after he was castigated for alienating the country's '47 per cent' who rely on government benefits to make ends meet. 'We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty,' Obama said, drawing jeers from lawmakers. 'That's great. Let's go. Come on. Let's do something about it.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama addressed the House Democratic Caucus retreat on January 29, 2015 in Philadelphia . Romney, an early front-runner in the Republican presidential sweepstakes after losing to Obama in 2012, made a campaign-style Wednesday night at Mississippi State University and focused on how the GOP should attack poverty. 'The rich have done historically well,' he said. 'I'm concerned about the middle class and the poor in this country.' Romney said Washington must 'lift people out of poverty' while it 'restore(s) opportunity, particularly for the middle class. He blamed the growing gap between rich and poor on 'liberal policies' emanating from Obama's Oval Office. And he fired back at the presdient with a tweet a few hours after Obama called him out for his newest messaging. 'Mr. Obama, wonder why my concern about poverty?' he wrote in Twitter's compressed 140 character format. 'The record number of poor in your term, and your record of failure to remedy.' In a sign of the partisan rancor that can bleed over into social media, the spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid snarked about Romney calling him 'Mr. Obama.' 'It's President Obama,' Adam Jentleson tweeted. Most of Obama's 20-minute speech Thursday night rehashed themes from his January 20 State of the Union address, but in one respect he put meat on what had been bare-bones messaging. Reporters were ushered out of the room at the Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel before a Q-and-A session began. But he is proposing to add $74 billion in new spending, about a 7 per cent increase, to the government's 2016 budget, splitting the additions between defense and domestic priorities . Obama himself proposed a mechanism known as a budget 'sequester' in 2011: Because Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on an annual budget for 2013, the previous year's budget was 'continued' – but with fixed percentages of the funds locked up and made unavailable. When Republicans called his bluff despite a harrowing impact on the Pentagon, the president sought to shift the blame back to them. But Watergate-era journalist Bob Woodward documented the source of the idea in his book, 'The Price of Politics,' showing that the White House pressed the 'sequester' plan on its own. On Thursday the president irged House Democrats to ignore that sequester entirely, complaining about 'manufactured crises and mindless austerity' in Washington. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney fired back Thursday night, only to hear the press spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid pounce over calling the president 'Mr. Obama' in the 140-character Twitter format .

He insisted he would find the money to pay for it by pressing for new taxes that will hit America's top income earners. That plan will undoubtedly hit roadblocks in the form of a Republican Party that now controls both houses of Congress and seems eager to stare Obama down. The president's new budget for 2016 will hit desks Monday morning on Capitol Hill. The GOP is expected to declare it 'dead on arrival' by Monday afternoon. 'I don't think there's going to be a lot of support for going back on the commitments we made to reduce spending,' South Dakota Republican Sen.

'It's going to be very hard to feature a scenario where Republicans on Capitol Hill are going to go along with some of the president's recommendations to increase spending.' 'Republicans are concerned about the impact of the sequester on the military budget,' he acknowledged. A divided government presents new problems for Obama – has last two years will be his first without Democrats in control of at least half of Congress – and he accepted some of the blame on Thursday for a mid-term election that turned into his party's worst nightmare.

The attack took place off a popular beach west of Auckland on Wednesday afternoon, police said, as people gathered there to enjoy the summer sunshine. The victim was a man in his 40s. He was swimming 200 meters (220 yards) offshore near Muriwai Beach, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from central Auckland when the 12-to-14-foot shark struck. ""We saw him rolling around, there was blood everywhere on the water,"" Pio Mose, who was fishing nearby, told local broadcaster 3 News. Mose said he believed at least two other sharks had joined in the frenzy around the body after a few minutes. The shark that attacked the swimmer was a great white, according to Russell Clark, a paramedic from the Westpac Rescue Helicopter service, which responded to the emergency at the beach. Police officers and life guards on the scene went out in inflatable boats. When they fired at the shark they saw by the body, it ""rolled over and disappeared,"" said Inspector Shawn Rutene. Following the death, police closed the beach and several others nearby. Auckland Council said it expected the area to remain closed for the next few days. Shark attacks kill about 25 people a year worldwide, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation. However, fatal attacks in the country's beaches have been rare.
